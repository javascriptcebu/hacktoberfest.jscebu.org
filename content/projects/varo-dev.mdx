This is an experimental project exploring how we can utilize AI and LLMs in our user experiences, in contrast to traditional UIs that we use today. Users can chat with our AI to look for developers to match with, and once they both match, they can chat with each other in the app for collaboration. We have lots of ideas for future features, such as showcasing open-source projects to match with to fully utilize this project's potential.
