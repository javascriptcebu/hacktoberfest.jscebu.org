This open source project is a redesign of the React Cebu website at [react.jscebu.org](https://react.jscebu.org). The old website repo can no longer be set up given its age. Thus, the team decided to start from scratch, thus, unexpectedly now they're competing on the [Hacktoberfest 2024](https://hacktoberfest.jscebu.org).
