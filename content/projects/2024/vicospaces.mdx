ViCo addresses the challenge of miscommunication during virtual brainstorming by providing a real-time collaborative whiteboard with shape library and chat integration, enabling clearer idea sharing. Built with Firebase for seamless data synchronization, it offers unique features like grid snapping for precision drawing and supports a highly interactive and user-friendly experience. The project showcases our team's flexibility, with each member contributing to different aspects of development, reflecting the same collaborative spirit we aim to deliver to users. We envision expanding ViCoSpaces with features like video call integration and AI-powered brainstorming tools as seen on our app's roadmap, making it suitable for various sectors, from education to corporate settings. Ultimately, ViCoSpaces aims to be the go-to platform for creative and effective remote teamwork.
