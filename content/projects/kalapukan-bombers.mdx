This assistant bot is designed to play alongside you, either to assist your main account or to boost an alternate account. Development started in October, initially using Java as that was the language being studied. Currently, the bot lacks multithreading and improved unit processing.

The bot can start its own game and follow a predefined strategy that sells all units except specific ones, such as Bandits, Hunters, Electro Robots, Trees, and Throwers. It automatically recruits units to earn credits for leveling up, collects daily rewards, and is currently being updated to handle shop automation. Future updates include adding automated Hunt Pass rewards collection. The strategy centers around obtaining the Bat Man unit and supporting units essential for its build, ensuring the bot actively contributes to winning.
