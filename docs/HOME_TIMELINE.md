## Maintenance

### Updating Events
To update the timeline:

1. Modify the `scheduleEvents` array in `app/page.tsx`:
```typescript
const scheduleEvents = [
  {
    date: "Month Day",      // e.g., "Oct 5"
    title: "Event Name",
    icon: "📅",             // emoji icon
    description: "Event description...",
  },
  // ... more events
];
```

2. Keep synchronized with `/events` page for consistency

3. Update both pages when:
   - Adding new events
   - Changing event dates
   - Updating event descriptions
   - Modifying event names

### Best Practices
- Keep descriptions concise (2-3 sentences)
- Use appropriate emojis that match event theme
- Maintain chronological order by date
- Ensure date format consistency (e.g., "Oct 5", not "October 5")
- Update both homepage and events page together
